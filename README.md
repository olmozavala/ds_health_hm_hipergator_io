#  HyperGator access and PyTorch data IO

The objectives of this homework are:
1. Practice accessing the HiperGator shared data folder.
2. Practice using PyTorch datasets and data loaders.

### Move your data to HiperGator (10 pts)
Create a folder  in the **shared** blue folder at `/blue/isc5935/shared/teamXX/data`.
The names should be in the format of `teamXX/data` where `XX` is the number of your team. 

Please describe the proposed organization of the data inside that folder.

Some examples of data organization are:
- `teamXX/data/raw/` - raw data
- `teamXX/data/processed/` - processed data
- `teamXX/data/processed/train/` - training data
- `teamXX/data/processed/test/` - test data
- `teamXX/data/processed/val/` - validation data
- `teamXX/data/processed/train/images/` - training images
- `teamXX/data/processed/train/labels/` - training labels
- `teamXX/src/` - source code

or you can use any other organization that you think is appropriate, just describe it in your *answer* notebook. 

Finally, copy your data to the cluster. 

### Dataset (10 pts)
Create a PyTorch dataset **MyGenerator.py** that loads the data from the folder or folders you created in the previous step.
One of the input parameters of your constructor should be *tranform*, which can be a transformation
applied to each of your generated samples.

The dataset must have at least three methods:
- `__len__` - returns the number of samples in the dataset
- `__getitem__` - returns a sample from the dataset (input and target)
- `__init__` - initializes the dataset

### Data loader and visualizer (10 pts)
In a jupyter notebook, create a simple ipwidget to visualize the data from your dataset.
In this widget you should be able to select the **batch size**. 
Using a button, the widget should display the images and corresponding target generated from the dataset for the selected batch size.

A simple example is available at [Datasets and DataLoader Example](https://github.com/olmozavala/ISC_5935_EXamples/blob/main/PyTorch/3_Data_Loaders.py).
